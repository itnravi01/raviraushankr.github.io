<h4>In my opinion the biggest way to help the martyred families is financial help.so,i donated a little amount of money to army relief funds.</h4>

<p>some people takes the responsibilities for bringing up martyred sons and daughters like <u>gautam gambhir</u> and also a school principal</br> sell their bangles for help because when see saw the pics of attack, she can't control her sentiments and emotions .</p>
<h3>But this time silent protest was not a solution.so,INDIA did <mark>AIR STRIKE</mark> by entering into pakistan and bombarded on terrorist camps.Nearly 200-300 terrorist were killed in this.</h3>
<p>By doing this INDIA proved himself as:</p>
<b>
<ol>
<li>Can't compromise with national security</li>
<li>Have ability to take revenge</li>
<li>Don't think india as before</li>
</b>
</ol>
<p>But many parties are politicising this attack. This raises some important questions:</p> 
<ul>
<h4>
<li>Are parties are above than the nation for these peoples?</li>
<li>Is it right to take votes on the name of our army?</li>
<li><span style="color:red">If you are taking responsibilty for <U>AIR STRIKE</U>,Then it is not your duty to take responsibilty for<u> martyred soldiers</u>?</li></span>
</h4>
